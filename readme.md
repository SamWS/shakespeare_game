# The Shakespeare game

## Instructions

This game is very simple. Login (or sign-up), then play! Before you will appear a random Shakespeare quote, along with a list of 4 plays. Simply select the play the quote is from and you get a point! See how many you can get in a row.

## Features

* Login, sign-up ability, as well as the ability to edit (or delete) your account.
* High score and current score tracker! If you've had enough and want to sign out, but you're on a streak, this game will remember your score the next time you sign in.
* This page has admin ability, so only certain people, i.e. me (and only me), can create, edit and delete the current plays and quotes listed in the system.
* A greeting for you on the home page!
* A gorgeous play button, oval shaped and all.
* Secure connection! Nobody but you can access your account. Don't forget that password!
* I'm really reaching for features to make this list longer.

## What was used to create this game

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Active Record
* Pry

## Unsolved Problems

* Haven't made the "forgot password" feature work yet.
* Haven't fixed the play_id input problem when posting a quote, as the system requires the play_id to have a valid play id.
* If you know where to look on the page, you can easily discern the correct answer while playing the game.
* When refreshing the page after getting the question correct, it logs another correct answer.
